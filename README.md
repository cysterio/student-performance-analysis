# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the factors influencing student academic performance using exploratory data analysis and a simple machine learning model.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Attendance percentage
- Daily study hours
- Previous academic scores
- Number of backlogs
- Final academic scores

## Methodology
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Seaborn.
- Visualized relationships between academic factors and performance.
- Conducted correlation analysis to quantify relationships.
- Built and interpreted a linear regression model to validate insights.

## Key Insights
- Study hours showed the strongest positive correlation with final scores.
- Attendance was also strongly correlated with performance.
- Backlogs had a clear negative impact on final scores.
- The regression model achieved an R² score of approximately 0.88.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights focused study time as the most influential factor in academic performance, while academic backlogs significantly reduce outcomes.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset for more robust modeling.
- Compare linear regression with non-linear models.
